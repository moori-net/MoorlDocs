## I can't find the block element for the plugin

Many have spent hours looking for the Block Element (for example, for the merchant search). However, a large part of my plugins do not have a block, but only an element.

Shopware distinguishes between blocks and elements. For example, a block can also consist of several elements. Generally you have access to my elements here:

Now you can select the corresponding element!

## The plugin does not run

If the plugin does not start for some reason, then check first if you have the current Shopware version and also if the plugin is up to date.

If this is the case, feel free to contact me immediately! My email address is info@moorleiche.com, I try to respond as soon as possible.

## I am missing an important function

I am always open for improvement suggestions, reasonable extensions are usually implemented with pleasure. I plan to develop my plugins with your help, wherever the journey goes.
