## What do I need forms for?

Forms or pre-printed forms are mainly used to mask relevant information and keep it to a minimum. They facilitate communication and can be better integrated into technical processes than, for example, e-mails.

## Which forms should I offer in my shop?

Forms are not mandatory, theoretically you can prepare every transaction by e-mail. However, sooner or later this will end in chaos. The data is also not usable for later processing and evaluations.

### General forms

- Customer registration and login
- Contact forms
- Newsletter forms
- Cancellation forms
- Return forms

### Nice-to-have forms

- Feedback forms
- Support forms

## How do I create a new CMS form in Shopware 6?

### Go to Contents | Form Builder 2

Here you will find a list with all forms from the plugin. You can also import forms here.

### Click on New in the top right-hand corner

A newly created form is created in the database and can be edited directly. The form is inactive until you release it.

### Select CMS as the form type

The more add-ons are installed, the more options you have for the scope of your form. In this example you create a form for the CMS pages of Shopware 6.

### In the tree structure you create the input elements

The tree structure allows you to create structure elements for the division of your forms. Here you can determine which elements are used in the form based on the type. Here, too, you are offered more options depending on the add-on.

### The finished form is saved

As soon as you have initially created your fields and want to test the form, you must first set the form to "active". The form of the type "Test" is very suitable for testing!

### Go to a CMS page of your choice

Navigate via the worlds of experience to the CMS page where you want to use the form.

### Select any element

The plugin does not offer a CMS block, you can select any CMS block. For example from [Foundation Features](../MoorlFoundation/features-premium.md).

### Test the form in the storefront

Now you can test the form. Don't forget to empty the Shopware cache when making adjustments to the form!
