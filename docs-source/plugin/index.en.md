## Improvement suggestions and ideas

### I am missing an important function

I am always open to suggestions for improvement, sensible enhancements are usually gladly implemented. I plan to continue developing my plugins with your help, wherever the journey takes me.

## Other questions

### What is your hourly rate?

- My hourly rate is €100.00 per hour plus VAT.
- Plugin updates that offer general added value for the general public are charged at €75.00 per hour plus VAT.

### Do you also develop Shopware 6 plugins for clients?

I like to develop new plugins and always bring in my own ideas. I aim to develop plugins that are as high-quality and comprehensive as possible and that are also suitable for Shopware's Community Store.

Here we always both profit from:

1. you get an affordable plugin tailored to your needs
2. your plugin is automatically developed further for you and is always compatible with the latest Shopware version
3. I can offer the plugin to other shop owners at an affordable price.

Of course, as the initiator you pay a relatively high price. However, you are making an essential contribution to the Shopware ecosystem and will also benefit in the long term from other plugins offered in the store.

I do not offer any further development for plugins that are similar to my plugins!

Feel free to send me a request via email :)

### Do you offer a complete package for Shopware 6?

For a new start with Shopware 6, I offer a complete package together with a narrow selection of specialised programmers and designers.

The services include

- Web server setup
- Shop installation
- Migration from Shopware 5 or other shop systems (Prestashop, xt:commerce, Shopify etc.)
- Interfaces, automated imports from CSV tables or APIs
- Shop concept and design
- Individual plug-in programming

However, no content or search engine marketing services are offered.

The project volume should be between 3 and 12 months.

### Can you support existing Shopware 6 shops?

As a rule, I only look after shops that are the result of my own projects.
