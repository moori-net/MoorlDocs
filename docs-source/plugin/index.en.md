## Problems installing plugins

### The moori Shopware 6 plugin cannot be installed

You get the following error message when trying to install the plugin?

```text
Required plugin/package "moorl/foundation 1.4.*" is missing or not installed and activated
```

Then you are missing the Foundation Plugin. You can get the plugin here:

### I can't find the block element for the plugin

Many people have spent hours looking for the Block Element (for example for the dealer search). 
However, a large part of the moori plugins do not have a block, but only an element.

Shopware distinguishes between blocks and elements. 
For example, a block can also consist of several elements. 
Generally you have access to the elements here:

Now you can select the corresponding element!
