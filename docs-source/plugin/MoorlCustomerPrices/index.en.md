## Initial Setup

### Plugin Configuration

1. Calculation priority: If other plugins are used that are involved in price calculation, the priority can be set here. The higher the priority, the earlier the price is calculated by this plugin.
2. Stop calculation after a match here: If other plugins are used that are involved in price calculation, this defines whether the calculation should continue. For example, fixed prices often have a higher priority; after that, no further price calculations should be performed.

## Setting a customer-specific price

Open a product in the admin and click on the tab `Customer-specific product prices`. There, a new entry can be created by selecting a customer and setting a price.

In the price settings, a tax rate is required to correctly display the price as gross and net. Additionally, the old base price or the old list price can be used as the new list price.
