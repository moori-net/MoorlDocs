# Store Locator | Base Version

_Note: This plugin requires the current version of [Foundation / Basis Plugin](../MoorlFoundation/index.md)._

---

This plugin contains the basic functions for a dealer search.
You can include any CSV export and complete it with the help
of the import wizard. Through the OpenStreetMap API you can
calculate the positions for the map during import. This API
does not require a key, such as Google Maps.

Attention: The storefront-controller has been removed in version 1.1.0,
the setup is now only possible via the adventure worlds.

Planned updates for the next 6 months (sorted by priority):

1. Create Twig blocks in the templates
2. Import / Export including tags, manufacturers and categories
3. Integration of own map tiles - see: https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/
4. Popup with contact form to contact the dealer directly via e-mail
5. Creating and linking CMS pages for traders
6. Better usability for the full-screen dealer search
7. Two further designs and colour schemes
