!!! note "Note for all customers who already own the Form Builder"

    This plugin has a fundamentally different structure and does not offer the possibility to migrate the previous forms.
          
    Unfortunately, it is also not possible to duplicate/transfer the subscriptions after consultation with Shopware.
          
    Since I don't want to put my existing customers at a disadvantage, the form construction kit will continue to be provided with updates. But no new functions will be developed.
          
    For all interested parties with active subscriptions I offer a 50% voucher for Basis and Add-Ons.
    
    The voucher is issued individually and cannot be combined with discount campaigns.

    If you have any problems with the plugin, please note the following [notes](../) in the FAQ section.
