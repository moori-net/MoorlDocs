                <p>
                    Hi! I'm Philipp or also known as the bog body. Why bog body?
                    Yes, that's a well-kept secret!
                    Because of the many confusing questions, I have changed my name to moori now.
                    I like to make small talk, but time is money - so let's cater to your needs instead!
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have a Shopware 6 shop, then you have probably already come across one or the other of my plugins.
                    Here you will find a bundled knowledge database about my plugins and maybe the
                    one or the other hint on useful features.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please don't be angry that some of the documentation is incomplete or not up to date.
                    <b>I'm trying to make it better now!</b>
                    Please send your questions and suggestions by e-mail to info@moorleiche.com.
